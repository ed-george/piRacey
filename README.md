pi-Racey: The Raspberry Pi Remote Controlled Car
-------------------------------------------------

This project aims to create a fully functioning Raspberry Pi based remote controlled car.

The project is adapted from a [Kaazing project](http://blog.kaazing.com/2013/04/01/remote-controlling-a-car-over-the-web-ingredients-smartphone-websocket-and-raspberry-pi/) that completes the same objective. Much of the source will be utilised and adapted to fit the needs of this project.
